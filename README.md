 | Prog_id | Program details | File Name |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|  1  | Write a C program to check if a given number is Fibonacci number | [p1-fibonacci.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/p1-fibonacci.c) |
|  2  |Write a C program to generate Pascal Triangle using array. | [p2-Pascaltriangle.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/p2-Pascaltriangle.c)|
|  3  | Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure and display the records in ascending order of roll list.| [p3-Ascending.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/p3-Ascending.c)|
|  4  | Write a C program to roll_no, name , percentange of 5 students using array of structure  and display the records in descending order of percentange.| [p4-Descending.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/p4-Descending.c) |
|  5  |Write a C program to find largest element in an array  | [p5-Largest.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/p5-Largest.c) |
|  6  |Write a menu driven program to perform the following operations in an ARRAY
1.INSERT
2.DELETE
3.TRAVERSE
4.SEARCH | [array1.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/array1.c) |
|  7  |Define a structure data type called time_struct containing 3 members int hour, int minute and int second. Write functions that accept the structure to perform the following operations: 1. Input new time
2.Display the time
3.Update the time such that the function accepts the time_struct and increments the time by one second.(If the increment results in 60 seconds, the then second member is set to 0 and the minute is incremented by 1. Then, if the result is 60 minutes, the minute member is set to 0 and the hour member is incremented by 1. Finally when the hour becomes 24, it is set to zero.) | [time.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/time.c) |
|  8  |Write a function that compares two arrays and returns 1 if they are identical and 0 otherwise. | [array_ops.c](https://github.com/Vanessa1410/Data-Structure-Lab/blob/main/array_ops.c) |
